  My attempt at speedrunning a talk…
---

This is my attempt at speedrunning a talk… 98 slides prepared in 2 hours and presented in 10 minutes at BarCamp Chiang Mai 2019.

Thanks [Phoomparin Mano](https://phoom.in.th/) for helping me with projector setup and recording the talk. Closed captions added due to my strong Tinglish accent.
