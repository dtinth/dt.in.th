In this talk, I encourage the audience to try solving everyday problems with code more.

I have been building [automatron](automatron.html), my personal assistant chat bot, for over 4 years now. The benefits extend far beyond just daily-life convenience, but also I got to try out many new things, and learned many useful skills along the way. This talk describes my journey and aims to inspire people to try solving everyday problems with code more.

This talk has 4 sections:

- **What does it do?** \
  I demoed [automatron](automatron.html), my personal assistant chat bot that I’ve been building for over 4 years, showing its various features and how it makes my life easier, such as home automation, expense tracking, and more.

- **Let’s build a basic bot!** \
  A step-by-step walkthrough of setting up a basic LINE bot on Glitch. Once a bot is set up, you can continue adding features of your own.

- **Technical details.** \
  I talk about the technical stuff behind my personal assistant system, and how it evolved over 4 years.

- **Conclusions.** \
  I talk about how solving everyday problems with code can be a great way to improve your skills, and I show how daily life becomes more convenient if you can achieve the “improvised coding” skill.
