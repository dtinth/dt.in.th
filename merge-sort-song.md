I tried to compose a song out of the Merge Sort algorithm.

Music created in Logic Pro X. Spent around 3 hours on this, so may look and sound a bit unpolished.

The note sequence is generated using a Ruby script. The sorting animation is done using HTML/CSS/JS with Vue.js. The source code is here: <https://github.com/dtinth/merge-sort-song>
