      This song is a [submission](http://manbow.nothing.sh/event/event.cgi?action=More_def&num=18&event=119) to the [Battle in the Mist 2ndMIX](http://bmsoffighters.net/bim/) event.

      ## Post-event comments
      > Now that the event has finished, here is some commentary about this song.
      >
      > ### Idea
      > I wanted to try creating a song that resembles the music style of Thai TV dramas, \
      > and also incorporate the feeling of playing a traditional Thai instrument.
      >
      > ### Instrumentation
      > The [HYPER] chart is the main chart in this song. \
      > It is designed so that the player feels like playing the “Ranat” instrument. \
      > Example of playing Ranat in Thai film: https://youtu.be/emqal9mfzh4?t=10s \
      > However, I cannot find a good sound source for a real Ranat, \
      > so I used the Marimba sound instead, which sounds a bit similar.
      >
      > ### Scale
      > The ‘Do’ note in many Thai instruments sounds like Bb in western music. \
      > Therefore, I used Bb major as the song’s key.
      >
      > ### Harmony
      > I tried to follow the popular harmony structure in Thai pop songs, \
      > while adding several chord substitutions to make it sound quite unique.
      >
      > ### Illustration
      > Big thanks to [Kikansha](https://twitter.com/kikansha_) for creating an illustration image. \
      > After I sent the demo, the conversation went something like this: \
      > “Got any illustration concept or rough art direction for this song?” \
      > “Nope, it’s all up to you.” \
      > “Well I’m thinking about Thai TV Dramas.” \
      > “That’s great!” \
      > I was happy that I was able to communicate the idea through music, and I was even more happy when I saw the finished art! It looks really great. Thanks again.
      >
      > ### Name
      > I just completely made up the song’s name. \
      > After the song is finalized, I realized that another popular TV drama also has a song (that I’ve never heard before) with a very similar name (“Just by looking at your eyes”), has the same key signature (Bb major), and uses the Fmin7 chord (the first chord with out of scale note) at the exact same place to set the listener up for the rest of the song.
      >
      > Thank you everyone for impression and for playing! \

      ## Submission text

      > Hello! \
      > This is flicknote. \
      > There were times when I feel something, but I don’t know what to do about it. \
      > I made some music instead.
      >
      > I put in several key modulations in the song to give it a bit of chaotic feeling. \
      > I also added a vocal track to help better convey the message in this song.
      >
      > For the vocals, I asked MindaRyn to help sing the vocals. \
      > I made some parts of the vocals very low-pitched to give the feeling of self-reflection. \
      > With the lowest note below the contralto range, I was a bit worried if she could sing it or not. \
      > It turns out that she could sing it well. I was very impressed. \
      > She also sang in another song of mine, [“Everyday evermore”](/music/everyday-evermore/). \
      > Please check out [her channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAvwaZwf1abbeREza8eA) for more of her vocal performances.
      >
      > Before I finish producing this song, I got affected by RSI (反復運動過多損傷). \
      > It caused pain in my hands. \
      > Because of that, I could not create all the note charts for this song. \
      > I asked [Dolphin](https://soundcloud.com/Dolphin) to help me design the note charts. \
      > He helped create the NORMAL (4), HYPER (9) and ANOTHER (12) charts. \
      > I made few minor adjustments afterwards. \
      > I also created a PIANO (11) chart which only contains the piano notes. \
      > With RSI, creating BMS is very exhausting. \
      > I hope I will get well soon.
      >
      > For the BGA, the visualization was generated procedurally using JavaScript code to process data from MIDI file. \
      > I experimented by assigning a different color to each pitch class. \
      > This allows you to also “see” the music in addition to hearing it.
      >
      > I hope that you will enjoy this song! \

      > This year I wanted to make a song outside of my normal style. \
      > So, this year, I wanted to try making a pop-rock song, a love song.
      >
      > Making this kind of song is not easy for me, given my personality. \
      > I have never written any song with lyrics. \
      > Let alone a love letter, or even a birthday card. \
      > But I want to try anyway.
      >
      > I could write only just a small verse. \
      > After that, I don’t know what to write anymore.
      >
      > I asked my musician friend ([Dekdekbaloo](https://github.com/dekdekbaloo)) to help me complete the lyrics. \
      > He also performed the guitar. \
      > I’m amazed that he can play along with such a fast song.
      >
      > [MindaRyn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAvwaZwf1abbeREza8eA) provided the vocals. \
      > Such a powerful vocal performance!
      >

      > I hope to make a longer version with Japanese vocals.
      >
      > I appreciate everyone’s help in this project.
      >
      > This song is based on piano and has intense drums. \
      > Therefore, I have also included the [PIANO] and [DRUMS] charts. \
      > I hope you will enjoy this song and its notecharts.
      >
      > p.s. \
      > I also made [another song](/music/bursting-music-star/) in team “隊.” \
      > In that song, I try to imitate a popular music style in northeastern Thailand. \
      > I hope to convey the feeling of Thai-style music. \
      > Please check it out, and I hope you also enjoy that!

      > This is the first song that I recorded with an electric guitar. \
      > I usually play acoustic guitar and sing pop songs.
      >
      > Collaborating with this project reminded me of the time \
      > when I was so much into music games such as DJ MAX, O2Jam, Osu etc. \
      > I am not that good at playing these games but I love music \
      > and many songs in the games are so well produced. \
      > I got goosebumps whenever I listen to one of these songs. \
      > I almost forgot that I really wanted to compose songs for music games at least once. \
      > This brings back good old memories.
      >
      > After listening to the song \
      > I've already felt the notes moving around on the game screen. \
      > The main idea is to make the notes sound fun to play. \
      > I slowly went through each section \
      > and put notes on each along with these crazy chord progressions we have.
      >
      > For the lyrics, \
      > I added the melody notes first and think up of a way to tell a love story. \
      > This is not a happy ending song nor a sad dramatic love story. \
      > I want listeners to feel about the time when you fell in love \
      > and you were really happy just by thinking of someone. \
      > So, combined with main theme of the chorus part, \
      > I created a back story which clarifies and connect all of the parts together \
      > leading to a wonderful ending.
      >
      > Make sure you listen to all parts in this masterpiece bits by bits. \
      > It shows you the blend of each unique artists' style which deliver to you awesomeness!
      >
      > I also wrote several songs and published with a record label "Garden Music" in Thailand. \

      ## Submission text

      > This year I wanted to make a song outside of my normal style.
      >
      > “Mor lam sing” is a modern music genre in the northeastern Thailand. \
      > It is based on an Isan/Lao music genre, “Mor lam,” or literally, “expert singer.” \
      > The word “sing” comes from “racing,” which refers to the fast tempo. \
      > It is a very popular genre in Thailand.
      >
      > Although I don’t usually listen to this music style, I hear them everywhere. \
      > In television. In taxis. In restaurants. In festivals. In concerts. \
      > They are just everywhere.
      >
      > I hear them so often that I thought, \
      > “I wanna try compose a song with this style of music, \
      > even when I don’t listen to them!”
      >
      > However, \
      > I don’t know anyone who could sing in this genre, \
      > so I can only make an instrumental version.
      >
      > I also remember… \
      > Last year, I got some comments during a BMS event. \
      > They said they’d like to hear some Thai-style music. \
      > That is also the inspiration for creating this song. \
      > So here it is.
      >
      > I hope you enjoy this song.
      >
      > p.s. \
      > I also made [another song](/music/everyday-evermore/) in “TEAM-BMSON.” \
      > It is a love song with vocals and lyrics in Thai. \
      > Please check it out, I hope you also enjoy that!
