I built this game as a playground in applying software engineering principles and practices,
and also as a [graduation project](https://gist.github.com/dtinth/0b633afa89a2a070647d).
The project is open source, and has automated tests as well as a CI/CD pipeline around it.

The gameplay is heavily inspired and influenced by Lunatic Rave 2, beatmaniaIIDX, and O2Jam. It is **key sounded**, meaning that each individual note gets its own sound. The song will sound off if you did not hit the notes correctly.

I created this project because most PC rhythm games only work on Windows, and I use a Mac. I originally designed this project for desktops and iPads, but being web based, the game could be made to work on more devices as mobile devices become more powerful over time, bringing a truly cross platform experience.

In 2018, a **3D mode** is added, and the game can be enjoyed in mobile phones.

**Party mode** lets multiple people play Bemuse together.

As of 2019, Bemuse has over **15,000 monthly active players.**
