description: A live coding session to demonstrate how React made me very productive.
---

In this session, I demonstrated how one can quickly create a simple React application by doing live coding.

React allowed me to be very productive when rapidly prototyping UIs thanks to its **tight feedback loop** (such as hot reloading).
The goal for this session is to let people interested in React see how React app development feels like when you become acquainted with it.

Presented at [React Bangkok 2.0.0](https://reactbkk.com/2.0.0/).

This resulting project (a live Twitter board for the event) would later be used in React Bangkok 3.0.0.
