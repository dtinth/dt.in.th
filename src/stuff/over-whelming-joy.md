A speedy carnival-style song.

`youtube: 0eRTa2NQ4r0`

This song is a [submission](http://manbow.nothing.sh/event/event.cgi?action=More_def&num=20&event=109) to the [Be Happiness!!!!](http://nextreflection.net/behappiness/) event.

## Submission text

> Hello! My name is flicknote.
>
> This BMS is an adaptation of a short song I composed 1 year ago.
>
> I started composing the BMS version just before the registration period began. \
> I have only 2 days to submit this song. Therefore, this song is done in a rush.
>
> My main objective is to practice making BMS quickly. \
> So the song is not very well polished and the BMS has only one level. \
> Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy playing this song.
>
> Thank you for playing! \
> — flicknote

Unfortunately, in a rush, I didn’t read the event rules carefully,
in particular, the part about using pseudonym (fake name).
Therefore, this song is disqualified from participating in the event.
Next time I will have to read the rules more carefully.
