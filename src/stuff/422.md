description: A song about unprocessed feelings.
---

This song is a [submission](https://bmssearch.net/venue/detail?event=3&id=42) to the [BMS 衆議院選](https://qstol.info/events/BMS_Shuin/) event.
This is the first song in which I compose the lyrics on my own.
I also made the video by myself, using THREE.js to generate the visualization based on MIDI data. [Source code is available.](https://github.com/dtinth/422)

## Submission text

> Hello! \
> This is flicknote. \
> There were times when I feel something, but I don’t know what to do about it. \
> I made some music instead.
>
> I put in several key modulations in the song to give it a bit of chaotic feeling. \
> I also added a vocal track to help better convey the message in this song.
>
> For the vocals, I asked MindaRyn to help sing the vocals. \
> I made some parts of the vocals very low-pitched to give the feeling of self-reflection. \
> With the lowest note below the contralto range, I was a bit worried if she could sing it or not. \
> It turns out that she could sing it well. I was very impressed. \
> She also sang in another song of mine, [“Everyday evermore”](/music/everyday-evermore/). \
> Please check out [her channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAvwaZwf1abbeREza8eA) for more of her vocal performances.
>
> Before I finish producing this song, I got affected by RSI (反復運動過多損傷). \
> It caused pain in my hands. \
> Because of that, I could not create all the note charts for this song. \
> I asked [Dolphin](https://soundcloud.com/Dolphin) to help me design the note charts. \
> He helped create the NORMAL (4), HYPER (9) and ANOTHER (12) charts. \
> I made few minor adjustments afterwards. \
> I also created a PIANO (11) chart which only contains the piano notes. \
> With RSI, creating BMS is very exhausting. \
> I hope I will get well soon.
>
> For the BGA, the visualization was generated procedurally using JavaScript code to process data from MIDI file. \
> I experimented by assigning a different color to each pitch class. \
> This allows you to also “see” the music in addition to hearing it.
>
> I hope that you will enjoy this song! \
