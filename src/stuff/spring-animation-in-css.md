Where design, programming, physics and calculus meet.

In this talk, I implemented a realistic spring-type animation using basic knowledge of physics and calculus. I talk about this because many software engineering students wonder if theyâ€™ll ever use the knowledge learn from the required Calculus and Physics course in their life. I want to show that knowledge allows you to be more creative.

Presented at [BarCamp Bangkhen 6](http://2015.barcampbangkhen.org/).
