An introductory lecture about TDD.

I gave this lecture to Computer Engineering students in a Seminar course.
In this lecture I give a gentle introduction to test-driven
development.

It is one of the most popular talks of mine ever.
When I published the slides, it got shared more than
1,000 times in the first day.
