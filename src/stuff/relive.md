## Submission text

> Hi! I’m flicknote, a BMS artist from Thailand.
>
> This year, I want to try making a song with Japanese lyrics. \
> So, I asked my sister (shioshiio) for some help in coming up with the lyrics, then I asked her to also sing it for me. (She’s not a professional singer, but she knows Japanese and likes to sing.)
>
> For the note chart, in most BMS files, you play many instruments at the same time. \
> For this song, I want to create the experience of playing just a single instrument. So I put in a synthesizer section that spans the whole song and make it challenging to play. You can try it in [5ANOTHER] and [7INSANE] charts.
>
> I hope you enjoy it!
