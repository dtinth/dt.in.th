## Submission text

> This year I wanted to make a song outside of my normal style.
>
> “Mor lam sing” is a modern music genre in the northeastern Thailand. \
> It is based on an Isan/Lao music genre, “Mor lam,” or literally, “expert singer.” \
> The word “sing” comes from “racing,” which refers to the fast tempo. \
> It is a very popular genre in Thailand.
>
> Although I don’t usually listen to this music style, I hear them everywhere. \
> In television. In taxis. In restaurants. In festivals. In concerts. \
> They are just everywhere.
>
> I hear them so often that I thought, \
> “I wanna try compose a song with this style of music, \
> even when I don’t listen to them!”
>
> However, \
> I don’t know anyone who could sing in this genre, \
> so I can only make an instrumental version.
>
> I also remember… \
> Last year, I got some comments during a BMS event. \
> They said they’d like to hear some Thai-style music. \
> That is also the inspiration for creating this song. \
> So here it is.
>
> I hope you enjoy this song.
>
> p.s. \
> I also made [another song](/music/everyday-evermore/) in “TEAM-BMSON.” \
> It is a love song with vocals and lyrics in Thai. \
> Please check it out, I hope you also enjoy that!
