A song to celebrate a new year!

Based on song "Sawasdee Pee Mai (สวัสดีปีใหม่)" by Suntaraporn (สุนทราภรณ์), a song about new year, by Thailand's most well-known big band.

Inspirations and Influences:

- I heard that song many times everywhere during the new year season and like it
- encX - Sawasdee (for remixing a thai traditional tune and inspiration for song title)
- Tatsh - reunion (for the genre "cyber waltz" and a speedy waltz song)
- ...and many other songs from various music games have also influences several parts of this song

HAPPY NEW YEAR 2013
