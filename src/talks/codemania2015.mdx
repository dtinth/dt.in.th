In this talk, I walked through the new technologies in front-end web
development that has become increasingly popular in 2015. It includes
browser technologies (WebGL, Web Audio, WebRTC, Service Worker),
development tools (preprocessing languages, transpilers, package
managers, module bundlers), and React library.

Presented at _Code Mania 10_.
