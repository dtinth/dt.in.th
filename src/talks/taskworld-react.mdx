In this talk, I and [Chakrit Likitkhajorn](https://medium.com/@chrisza)
presented about the basic concepts of React.js and how Taskworld uses
React.js in its front-end. Topics include declarative views,
functional components, virtual DOM, and handling state changes. It
also explores the benefits and challenges of using React, and gives a
quick overview of Redux, a state management solution.

Presented at [BKK WEB Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bkk-web/events/231034570/) and [Facebook Developer Circles Bangkok: Meetup Launch '&' Hackathon](https://www.eventpop.me/e/2489)
