<Intro>
  
Where design, programming, physics and calculus meet.

</Intro>

In this talk, I implemented a realistic spring-type animation using
basic knowledge of physics and calculus. I talk about this because
many software engineering students wonder if theyâ€™ll ever use the
knowledge learn from the required Calculus and Physics course in their
life. I want to show that knowledge allows you to be more creative.
