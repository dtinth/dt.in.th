In this talk, I presented about higher-order functions, and a pattern
for solving code duplication in React components using higher-order
components. I also talked about how object-oriented programming
(pursuing well-factored code) and functional programming (pursuing
predictable code) goes hand in hand.

Presented at [React Bangkok 1.0.0](https://reactbkk.github.io/1.0.0/).
