In this talk, I showed my VIM configuration, as well as tricks and plugins that I use.

Presented at [BarCamp Bangkhen 4](http://2013.barcampbangkhen.org/).

This talk became famous when an audience asked which tool I used to display the keystrokes at the top of the screen.

To aid with the live demo, the day before the talk I created a tool which displays the keystrokes as I type commands into Vim. For lack of a name, I called it ‘a tool I just made yesterday.’

Since I couldn’t use my hands to control it (since they will be typing Vim commands), I created a web-based iPad app, [iPedal](/p/ipedal/), which lets me use my foot to control it. The audience reaction can be seen at 14:15 into the video.
