In this talk, I and [Chakrit Likitkhajorn](https://medium.com/@chrisza)
presented about the basic concepts of React.js and how Taskworld uses
React.js in its frontend.

Topics include declarative views,
functional components, virtual DOM, and handling state changes. It
also explores the benefits and challenges of using React, and gives a
quick overview of Redux, a state management solution.

Presented at [BKK WEB Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bkk-web/events/231034570/) and [Facebook Developer Circles Bangkok: Meetup Launch '&' Hackathon](https://www.eventpop.me/e/2489)
