  Turning a MIDI keyboard into a light switch for my room.

Philips Hue’s official light switches are too expensive!

My room uses **Philips Hue** for lighting. I remotely control them using [automatron, my personal chatbot](./automatron.md).

In June 2020, the lightbulbs went on a massive sale on Lazada (50% off),
so I wanted to get another lightbulb for my bathroom. So that my bathroom has RGB colors.

But having to control my bathroom lighting via a chatbot every time? Nah, too inconvenient!
And their lightswitches, even though they are on sale, they’re still relatively expensive.
Probably not worth my money.

I happen to have an unused **MIDI controller** though… A nanoKEY2… So I turned it into a light switch.

Not only does it control lights, it also makes sound when pressed, so I can use it as a piano!
