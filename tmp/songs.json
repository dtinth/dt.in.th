It looks really great. Thanks again.\n>\n> ### Name\n> I just completely made up the song’s name. \\\n> After the song is finalized, I realized that another popular TV drama also has a song (that I’ve never heard before) with a very similar name (“Just by looking at your eyes”), has the same key signature (Bb major), and uses the Fmin7 chord (the first chord with out of scale note) at the exact same place to set the listener up for the rest of the song.\n>\n> Thank you everyone for impression and for playing! \\\n> flicknote\n"
