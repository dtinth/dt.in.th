I tried to compose a song out of the Insertion Sort algorithm. This time the song has lyrics.

**◆ How this is created** \
Starting with a shuffled array of note pitches, the Insertion Sort algorithm is used to sort this array from highest to lowest note. Each time it reads a value from the array, the corresponding note is generated. Using the resulting melody, I composed the accompaniment and produced the song in Logic Pro. Animation created using THREE.js with TypeScript, rendered using `html5-animation-video-renderer` and edited in Final Cut Pro.

**◆ Lyrics:** \
Insertion sort… Do I belong here? \
If so, I’ll stay… Or else I’ll move to the left
