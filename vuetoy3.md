**vuetoy3** is a minimalistic boilerplate for quickly building web prototypes using Vue 3 without any build tool or development server.

- to run the app, just double-click `index.html` (no dev server)
- to make changes, just edit `script.js` (no build tool)

</template>

This is ideal for building small side-projects, where you:

- want to use [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and its [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html#why-composition-api)
- want multiple routes (it comes with [Vue Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/))
- prefer not to use any build tool
- donâ€™t need to support older browsers
- want IntelliSense in your editor (it comes with a typings file)
