I tried to compose a song out of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Music created in FL Studio 20.5. Might sound a bit generic/unpolished because I only spent 40 minutes on this, just to see if it would work.

The sorting animation is done with HTML/CSS/JS with Vue.js. The source code is here: https://glitch.com/~bubblesort
